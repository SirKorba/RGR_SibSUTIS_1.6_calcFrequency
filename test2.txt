Oh, won't you tell me? Please just tell me.

Explain how this should work.

Well now who could it be, that lives inside of me?

I'm broken, lying helpless, shattered

Surrounded by the world

And yet, you're smiling bright

Completely blind to life

My ruptured lungs; they were left this way

 For once, I'm out of breath.

The truth I seek, never felt so bleak but,

I maintain my depth

Freeze

I'm breakable;

Unbreakable

I'm shaking yet,

Unshakable

Until the day that you find me.

I'll stand here,

Existing and feeling wretched existence

Consuming life force till I grow distant

Don't bother searching for somebody like me.

A fading no one.

I don't want to hurt you, It's not my nature.

A monster born from dusk to dawn can't be your saviour

Remember the 'me', the way I used to be.

As who I still should be.

The isolation spreads and tears

Those happy days, pierce into me

These lonely memories cease to care

They spread throughout my history

I’ll never move

I’ll never lose

I’ll never move

I’ll never lose

I’ll never move

I’ll never lose you!

Unraveling the world

At once, I start changing,

Yet everything’s remaining

These lives I felt would join as one,

They fade away before they’ve begun.

I’m breakable;

unbreakable

I’m shaking yet,

unshakable

Until these hands contaminate you

I’ll stand here existing and feeling wretched existence

Consuming life-force till I grow distant

Don't bother searching for somebody like me.

A fading no one.

This lonely space, held into place by someone crazy

Shall melt away like dawn to day as things get hazy

So please think of me, the way I used to be.

As who I really should be

So don’t forget me,

You can’t forget me

You won’t forget me

Please don’t forget me.

With changing inside I’m completely paralyzed

Remaining corrupt as I wish for paradise

Remember the 'me', the way I used to be.

Oh, won’t you tell?

Oh, please just tell

Well now who could it be, that lives inside of me?
